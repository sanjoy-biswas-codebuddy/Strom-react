Let's build a **Task Management App** idea and add a **"Collaborative Workspace"** feature to make it more complex and engaging. This additional layer allows **multiple users** to interact, manage shared tasks, and assign tasks to one another. Here's the updated project idea:

---

### **Project Overview**

**"Collaborative Task Management App"**  
A full-stack application where users can:

1. **Register/Login**: Authenticate users.
2. **Create Workspaces**: A workspace can have multiple users.
3. **Assign Tasks**: Assign tasks to specific users in the workspace.
4. **Role-Based Access Control**: Assign roles (e.g., Admin, Member) to users in a workspace, affecting what actions they can perform.
5. **Real-Time Updates**: Use polling or optimistic updates for a real-time feel.
6. **Activity Logs**: Track task updates (e.g., "Task completed by User A" or "Task assigned to User B").
7. **Search and Filters**: Advanced task filtering by user, due date, or status.

### **Features and Core Concepts**

#### **Frontend (React)**

1. **Authentication**:
   - Use a mock auth system with JWT (simulated with JSON Server for now).
   - Teach protected routes using React Router.
2. **Dynamic Routing**:
   - Routes for individual workspaces and user-specific tasks (`/workspace/:id`).
3. **State Management**:
   - Manage global state for user data and workspaces using React Context or Zustand.
4. **Form Validation**:
   - Use React Hook Form and Yup for forms:
     - Register/Login
     - Create/Update Workspaces
     - Add/Edit Tasks
5. **Data Fetching with TanStack Query**:
   - Efficiently fetch, cache, and update task and workspace data.
   - Demonstrate query invalidation and optimistic updates.
6. **Collaborative Features**:
   - Assign tasks to specific users.
   - Show task ownership and allow reassignment.
7. **Role-Based Access**:
   - Admins can create/delete tasks and invite/remove members.
   - Members can only complete tasks or update their assigned tasks.

#### **Backend (JSON Server)**

1. **Data Models**:
   - **Users**: `id`, `name`, `email`, `password`, `role`
   - **Workspaces**: `id`, `name`, `description`, `members`
   - **Tasks**: `id`, `title`, `description`, `status`, `assigneeId`, `workspaceId`
   - **Activity Logs**: `id`, `workspaceId`, `userId`, `action`, `timestamp`
2. **Endpoints**:
   - `/users`: Manage user data (login simulation).
   - `/workspaces`: CRUD operations for workspaces.
   - `/tasks`: CRUD for tasks (filterable by `workspaceId` and `assigneeId`).
   - `/logs`: Track activities in workspaces.

### **Step-by-Step Implementation**

#### 1. **Setup JSON Server**

- Define relationships between users, workspaces, and tasks using JSON Server with a `db.json` file.

#### 2. **User Authentication**

- Simulate login with a JSON Server endpoint.
- Use JWTs (mocked for now) to demonstrate protected routes.

#### 3. **Create Workspaces**

- A form to create workspaces with validation using React Hook Form and Yup.
- Allow users to invite others to join the workspace.

#### 4. **Task Management**

- Workspace-specific tasks fetched using TanStack Query.
- Task assignment with user selection.
- Filter and sort tasks based on status, assignee, or due date.

#### 5. **Role-Based Features**

- Admin users can manage members and tasks.
- Members can only interact with tasks assigned to them.

#### 6. **Activity Logs**

- Log every action in the workspace (e.g., task creation, updates, etc.).
- Display logs in a workspace dashboard.

#### 7. **Styling & UI**

- Use libraries like Mantine or Material UI for responsive and attractive components.
- Include modals, tables, and cards for task and workspace management.

### **Stretch Goals**

1. **Real-Time Collaboration**:
   - Use polling or optimistic updates for a real-time experience.
   - Teach students how WebSockets could be integrated in the future.
2. **Pagination and Infinite Scrolling**:
   - Apply pagination for tasks in large workspaces.
3. **Notifications**:
   - Mock notifications for task assignment or completion.

### **Outcome**

By the end of this project, learners will understand core React concepts and advanced ones like:

- Dynamic routing
- Form validation with Yup
- Query invalidation and optimistic updates
- Role-based access control
- Collaborative application design patterns

This project is robust enough to challenge beginners but still achievable with guidance! Would you like a detailed breakdown of any specific module?
